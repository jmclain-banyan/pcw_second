# Project_Candy_Warz

This is the original code base for the fullstack app. I did this a graduation project for code camp. At the time we had no internet at limited and sometimes outdated resources, lol.

I'm currently working on a new full stack app using different technologies.

In order to run this locally you need to have Mongo DB running on port 27017 (default). This doesn't work with any remote database.

The rest of the instruction are in instructions.md
